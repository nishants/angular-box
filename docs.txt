arch : 
 AppController : 
 - parent of each scope in the app
 - place to put int app logic like login, splash-screen, navigation, loading static data

application-scope : 
 - holds data shared across the elements, 
 - better alternative : use a service/ say appService instead of app-scope. (allows encapsulating the data)

On landing : 
- index page launched, with app controller.
- app controller shows splash-screen(say loader), while it loads the static data
- then it puts the static data on "appplication-scope"
- now static data is avialable to all the controllers/views through their own scope.

Issues: 
- angularjs bad error message
- routing errors/ injection errors etc, are not descriptive
- solutions : 
    - remember error messages 
    - look up on google
    - make architecture more suitable for it
